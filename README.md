Greetings and a warm welcome to the exciting AirBnB clone (Hbnb) project, where we aim to replicate the functionalities and user experience of the renowned AirBnB platform. This venture serves as a hands-on learning opportunity, allowing us to delve into the intricacies of creating a similar platform, including property listings, bookings, and more. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and innovation together!

## Commencing the Journey

**What exactly is a command interpreter?**

Do you recall the concept of the Shell? Well, think of it as similar, but tailored for a particular purpose. In our scenario, we seek to employ this specialized interpreter to effectively oversee and manipulate the various components and objects within our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object.

### Learning Objectives

## General
- How to create a Python package

- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project

- How to serialize and deserialize a Class

- How to write and read a JSON file

- How to manage datetime

- What is an UUID

- What is *args and how to use it

- What is **kwargs and how to use it

- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF help quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

**But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)**

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py

(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================

EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
